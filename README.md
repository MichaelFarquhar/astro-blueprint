**Astro Blueprint** is a barebones template built on Astro 4. This template servers as the perfect starting point to any Astro project without any extra fluff. It includes useful integrations such [astro-icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon), [@astrojs/sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/) and [@astrojs/partytown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/partytown/).

## 🛠️ Installation
